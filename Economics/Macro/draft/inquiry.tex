\section*{Topic}
The article chosen discussed the impact of COVID-19 on the economy of New Zealand in 2020. It stated a measured 12.2\% decrease in the national nominal GDP, as well as classifying the status as ``the deepest recession in decades''. This discussion will focus on the change in the retail sectors of the economy through the application of economic theory, and will evaluate its broader impacts on the wider economy.

\section*{Theory}
As stated in the article, the pandemic had directly affected the retail industry in a perceived decrease in production quantity. This is very likely caused by various international travel bans and strict nationwide lockdowns.
