How creative and persuasive text explore the issue of slavery - Culture, Identity, and Community

\paragraph{Literary Text}
Perfume, The Story of a Murder, by Patrick Su\"skind

\begin{linenumbers}
    From his first glance at Monsieur Grimal --- no, from the first breath that sniffed in the odor
enveloping Grimal --- Grenouille knew that this man was capable of thrashing him to death for the least
infraction. His life was worth precisely as much as the work he could accomplish and consisted only of
whatever utility Grimal ascribed to it.

And so, Grenouille came to heel, never once making an attempt
to  resist.  With  each  new  day,  he  would  bottle  up  inside  himself  the  energies  of  his  defiance  and
contumacy  and  expend  them  solely  to  survive  the  impending  ice  age  in  his  ticklike  way.  Tough,
uncomplaining,  inconspicuous,  he  tended  the  light  of  life’s  hopes  as  a  very  small,  but  carefully
nourished flame. He was a paragon of docility, frugality, and diligence in his work, obeyed implicitly,
and appeared satisfied with every meal offered. In the evening, he meekly let himself be locked up in a
closet off to one side of the tannery floor, where tools were kept and the raw, salted hides were hung.
There  he  slept  on  the  hard,  bare  earthen  floor.  During  the  day  he  worked  as  long  as  there  was
light-eight  hours  in  winter,  fourteen,  fifteen,  sixteen  hours  in  summer.  He  scraped  the  meat  from
bestially  stinking  hides,  watered  them  down,  dehaired  them,  limed,  bated, and fulled  them,  rubbed
them down with pickling dung, chopped wood, stripped bark from birch and yew, climbed down into
the tanning pits filled with caustic fumes, layered the hides and pelts just as the journeymen ordered
him,  spread  them  with  smashed  gallnuts,  covered  this  ghastly  funeral  pyre  with  yew  branches  and
earth.  Years  later,  he  would  have  to  dig  them  up  again  and  retrieve  these  mummified  hide
carcasses-now tanned leather --- from their grave.

When he was not burying or digging up hides, he was hauling water. For months on end, he
hauled  water  up  from  the  river,  always  in  two  buckets,  hundreds  of  bucketfuls  a  day,  for  tanning
requires vast quantities of water, for soaking, for boiling, for dyeing. For months on end, the water
hauling left him without a dry stitch on his body; by evening his clothes were dripping wet and his skin
was cold and swollen like a soaked shammy.

\paragraph{Language Text} What to the slave is the Fourth of July? By Frederick Douglass

https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jul/05/frederick-douglass-anti-slavery-speech-what-to-the-slave-is-the-fourth-of-july

\resetlinenumber
\begin{linenumbers}
 What, to the American slave, is your Fourth of July? I answer: a day that reveals to him, more than all other days in the year, the gross injustice and cruelty to which he is the constant victim. To him, your celebration is a sham; your boasted liberty, an unholy license; your national greatness, swelling vanity; your sounds of rejoicing are empty and heartless; your denunciations of tyrants, brass-fronted impudence; your shouts of liberty and equality, hollow mockery; your prayers and hymns, your sermons and thanksgivings, with all your religious parade, and solemnity, are, to him, mere bombast, fraud, deception, impiety, and hypocrisy – a thin veil to cover up crimes which would disgrace a nation of savages. There is not a nation on the earth guilty of practices, more shocking and bloody, than are the people of these United States, at this very hour.

 Go where you may, search where you will, roam through all the monarchies and despotisms of the old world, travel through South America, search out every abuse, and when you have found the last, lay your facts by the side of the everyday practices of this nation, and you will say with me, that, for revolting barbarity and shameless hypocrisy, America reigns without a rival.

 Americans! Your republican politics are flagrantly inconsistent. The existence of slavery in this country brands your republicanism as a sham, your humanity as a base pretense, and your Christianity as a lie. It destroys your moral power abroad; it corrupts your politicians at home. It saps the foundation of religion; it makes your name a hissing, and a byword to a mocking earth. It is the antagonistic force in your government, the only thing that seriously disturbs and endangers your Union. It fetters your progress; it is the enemy of improvement, the deadly foe of education; it fosters pride; it breeds insolence; it promotes vice; it shelters crime; it is a curse to the earth that supports it; and yet, you cling to it, as if it were the sheet anchor of all your hopes. Oh! Be warned! Be warned! A horrible reptile is coiled up in your nation’s bosom; the venomous creature is nursing at the tender breast of your youthful republic; for the love of God, tear away, and fling from you the hideous monster, and let the weight of twenty millions crush and destroy it forever!

 Allow me to say, in conclusion, notwithstanding the dark picture I have this day presented of the state of the nation, I do not despair of this country. There are forces in operation, which must inevitably work the downfall of slavery. “The arm of the Lord is not shortened,” and the doom of slavery is certain. I, therefore, leave off where I began, with hope.

\paragraph{Notes}

\paragraph{Language Text}

Author: Escaped slavery, became national leader of movement in Massachusetts and New Work, famous for speaking. As a living counterexample to the arguments at the time in the inability of slaves to conceive intellectual capacity. Northerners surprised he was a slave.

During the civil war, Douglass argued for the men of color to enlist, quoting a witness of black confederates with muskets.

Background: Recorded on the 5th of July in 1852, indoors in the state of New York. The state is a center of slavery in the 1700, with more than 2/5 households owning slaves. The speech is conducted after the ending of the civil war, and Lincoln's death with the 13th amendment, where racial tension is still high.

\section{Format}

Topic: Culture, Identity, and Community, ``How creative and persuasive text explore the issue of slavery?''
\begin{itemize}
    \item FSD
\end{itemize}

\section{Speech}
My literary extract is Perfume, ``the story of a murderer'' from author Patrick Suskind, written and published in the 20th century. My language text is an extract of the speech ``What to the slave is the Fourth of July?'' by Frederick Douglass, performed in the 19th century. I will be exploring the global issue of Culture, Identity, and Community, because I have previously explored language texts around social issues, and wanted to compare it to a more literary text, such as Perfume. The key area I'll be exploring is the social and economic issues of industrialization, and I hope to answer the question of ``How creative and persuasive text describe slavery?''.

% perfume
The first extract Perfume, is a realistic fantasy novel, set in the 18th century romantic era central France. In the extract Grenouille is seen to be sold to a tanner Monsieur Grimal after his time in the orphanage, and it describes his next years as a young worker. More widely speaking, the unappetizing descriptions of the social and environmental settings connect to Suskind's uneasiness towards industrialization.
% adjectives
Most visible are the uses of strong and specific adjectives throughout the extract. Positive adjectives on line 9 --- describing Grenouille as the ``paragon of docility, frugality, and diligence'' frames the socially accepted form of a worker. But the connotations of the adjective depreciates over the course of the extract, from the ``raw, salted hides'' on line 12, to a ``bestially stinking hides'' on line 15, using the hides as an analogy of Grenouille as he persists through slavery, and ultimately stating the author's perception of the cost of industrialization. This references my key area, for it explores one of the multiple interpretation of the issues with the industry era. This also ties-in with the realistic part of the novel, and contrast with the fictional previous section of the nursery, creating a striking image in the readers to be memorized.
% irony
The section from line 19 to 21, stating ``he would have to dig them up again and retrieve these mummified hides'', comes up to be ironic. The digging of the hides is a analogy of a slave digging his own grave, showcasing the crude reality as interpreted by the author, which is further reinforced later in line 25, ``the water hauling left him without a dry stitch on his body'', comparing Grenouille's body with the hides he is soaking, connecting to the idea that there is a lack of differentiation between slaves and resources. This ties into the economical issues of slavery, that labor is treated as a factor of production, for on line 3 to 4, Grenouille's life is ``worth precisely as much as the work he could accomplish''. Against the wider world, this is a reflection on the existence and peek of the Atlantic slave trade in the 18th century, where adults and children alike were employed for the sake of production. This use of irony allows the reader to pause and reflect on their moral stances upon this issue of slavery.
% metaphor
Metaphors are used in associating Grenouille with various animals. Such as on line 7, ``to expend them solely to survive the impending ice age in his ticklike way'', associating Grenouille as a tick and the slavery as an ice age. This ties back to the use of adjectives in exaggerating the power difference between Grenouille and his owner, for a tick is powerless against a natural disaster, like how the young character has no power in the extract. Additionally, the naming of Grenouille --- french word for frog, connects to this aspect of power. Each chapter corresponds to the growth stages of the character: from an egg, to a tadpole, than to a maturing tadpole, and finally as an adult frog. This is seen as a rejection of the systematic view of life, but seeking to represent growth through natural processes --- a key idea in romanticism. This links back to the analogy on line 12 and 15, comparing the process of slavery to that of a hide being buried, easing the interpretation of slavery as a natural process. This ultimately leads to the reader sympathizing with the character, showcasing that factual information in the form of statistics is not necessary required in areas of literature and creative works --- something the wider text disagrees with for its scientific approach to perfume making.
% idea
This is important in developing Grenouille as the paragon of creativity and artistic. He later approached perfume making not through measurement and theory, but through the imagination of the mind. The context of this is significant in that it showcases the decrease in the appreciation to human creativity over time, marking the industrial revolution as the turning point of creative works and human imagination. The avocation of modern slavery is commonly associated with numbers and listings, ironically becoming more inline with the concept of treating people as mere numbers rather than a living animals.
% link
The two extracts differ in their motivations and target audience, therefore the approach to the global issue is dependence upon the context where it is raised and evaluated against.
