\end_inset

Moonlight
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

. While it is common sense that the further you are from a light source, the less bright it seems. I was fascinated by how quickly the brightness had decreased, so much so that a sun-like light-bulb can be so dim only 100 meters away. I want to test how the light intensity changes with the distance to the light source.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Additionally, the relationship between light intensity and distance to the light source can reveal the efficiency of the light source: known as the typical luminous efficacy and measured in

 of light waves per unit power, or lumens per watt. I decided to select one of the light-bulbs from the school's physics department and test its efficiency, because the class have been exclusively using them in learning the topic of electricity. I am curious in finding out how the efficiency of this light-bulb compares to a list of common light sources.

%During the examination of a potential IA idea on the intensity of a refracted light-beam, I struggled with modeling a realistic light due to a lack of understanding and care towards the decrease in intensity of the light with respect to the distance. Because the glass cube I was working with had significant length, the decrease in intensity of the light-beam within the glass damaged my data and exponentially increased the difficulty in linearization. Therefore, I wanted to empirically see how the difference in distances will affect the measurement of light intensity. Additionally, I found the labs bulbs are prone to extreme heat even with little power and on duration. Thus, I thought to use this experiment to find the luminous efficacy of an incandescent lab light-bulb to confirm my suspicion.

Background
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For a light-bulb to produce light, an electrical current in the form of moving electrical charges must pass through a light emitting electrical resistor. This experiment will use an incandescent light-bulb as the light source, which functions by heating a wire filament to a temperature that emits light. For light waves are forms of energy, the amount of light produced is depended on the energy per second dissipated within the filament, known as power and represented with symbol 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

. Power is defined as the voltage 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 across the resistor times the current 
\begin_inset Formula $I$
\end_inset

 through the resistor, shown in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

plural "false"

\end_inset

. The higher the power dissipated within the light-bulb, the brighter the light-bulb is.

%While there exists difference in the efficiency of such resistors --- modern light emitting diodes (LED) are much more energetically efficient comparing to an incandescent light-bulb, the physical result: needed to illuminate a room through the emission of light waves in the visible spectrum, does not differ. Therefore, the theoretical definition of the rate of work, $P$, is only depended upon the level of electrical current (the flow rate of charges), and voltage (the work potential of charges), shown in figure

However, the light sensor I used instead measures light intensity in illuminance with unit lux. This is because the human eye does not perceive each wavelength of the electromagnetic spectrum equally â€” red light appears dimmer than green light at the same intensity, and the unit illuminance takes this into consideration by weighting each wavelength differently. Illuminance is defined through the following equation, where 
\begin_inset Formula $d$

\begin_inset Formula $y(\lambda)$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

To test the inverse square law, I decided to use a light sensor against a 5 watt light-bulb taken from the physics department. The light-bulb is supplied with only 8 volts out of the 12 volts power supply, as from past experience the bulb gets dangerously hot quickly on 12 volts. The dependent variable is the illuminance measurements from the light sensor, which ranges from 0-6000 lux. The independent variable is the distance of the light sensor from the light-bulb, ranging from 0.030m to 0.10m with steps of 0.01m, as this range provides a wide range of illuminance values from the specific light sensor. This is repeated for a total of 5 times because the light sensor often fluctuates even when held completely still. The repetition can help in reducing the uncertainties of the illuminance measurements.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
%To test my hypothesis, I thought to conduct the experiment on the small 5W lab light-bulbs, for they have a tendency to heat up quickly before. Through some preliminary testing, I decided to decrease the supply voltage: the bulb gets dangerously hot on 12V, and placing sensor no closer than 3cm, and no further than 10cm, for at too close the illuminance exceeds the limits of the sensor, and that illuminance quickly drops off from the starting value, bringing no need of longer distances.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Additionally, I decided to connect a voltmeter along side an ammeter, because I have observed that the voltage provided by the supply always decreases when a component is connected to it. This is likely due to the internal resistance within the power supply. Therefore the voltmeter ensures a more accurate voltage measurement than the knob value on the power supply.

Result
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There exists a clear and strong inverse squared relationship between the illuminance and the distance to the light-bulb, as shown in the transformed graph in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "gph:tdata"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, and the close to one correlation coefficient 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{0.9995}=0.9997$
\end_inset

. This shows that as the distance to a light source increases, the illuminance decreases relatively rapidly at close distances but relatively less at far distances, and vice versa.

%Following the data collection and some transformation for linearization, the relationship is summarized in figure 
\backslash
ref{fig:rel}. The data had mostly supported the theory of the inverse square law. From figure 
\backslash
ref{gph:average}, one can see the that the measured illuminance falls rapidly when the distance to source increases. To create a linear curve, the illuminance ($E_v$) is plotted against the inverse square of the distance ($
\backslash
frac{1}{d^2}$) shown in figure 
\backslash
ref{gph:tdata}. The small variance of the data points from the regression line is a strong evidence to support my hypothesis.

\begin_layout Standard
However, the theory of inverse square law also suggests that the relationship curve should have a y-intercept of 0. The non-zero y-intercept of the regression line â€” even considering the ranges of uncertainty (
\begin_inset Formula $0 \notin [10, 50]$
\end_inset

), suggests some systematical errors are present. The curve is shifted upwards by a sizable amount, which could be caused by the erroneous reading of the ambient illuminance, parallax error in aligning the ruler, or by a lack of calibration of the light sensor. This indicates that the experiment data was not very accurate.

The graph (figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "gph:tdata"
plural "false"
caps "false"

\end_inset

) consists of noticeable sized error bars that increases as distance increases. This is caused by the small distances used in combination with the moderately uncertain wooden ruler used. However the results are overall relatively precise due to the low percentage uncertainty of the two axis (figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

, figure

%The high correlation coefficient showcases the strong inverse squared relationship between the distance to the light source and the illuminance. This is because light waves from a light source radiates outwards in a perfect sphere, with surface area inversely proportional to the distance to its origin squared. As light intensity is measured in power per area, the larger the sphere surface area, the less intensity of the light as the amount of light waves spreads out. This means that the light intensity is also inversely proportional to the distance squared.

%Additionally, the experimental data contains a noticeable amount of uncertainties indicated by the large error bars, particularly at smaller distances. There also exists large random error in the illuminance measurement, as indicated by the high half ranges of the trials of illuminance measurements during averaging (figure 
\backslash
ref{fig:average}) --- sometimes to a degree of $102/1798 
\backslash
approx 5.7
\backslash
%$ at the distance of $3
\backslash
si{cm}$. This is most likely caused by the fluctuation of the light level in the room, which is likely caused by the leakage of sunlight through the window blinds. This is also reflected in the gradient calculations, for the slope had a relatively large uncertainty of $12.1
\backslash
%$, supporting the presence of large random errors. However, the averaging of the data seemed to reduce the effects of the error. The line of best fit passed through all 8 points of the independent variable, and had a very high R-squared value of $0.9995$ and R value of $
\backslash
sqrt{0.9995} 
\backslash
approx 0.9997$. This shows a high level of correlation in the data. In conclusion, the raw dataset presented in figure 
\backslash
ref{fig:raw} is said to be highly accuracy but less precise, and contains medium amounts of uncertainty.

This is also known as the typical luminous efficacy, one that I can use to compare to other light-bulbs using an online database. Furthermore, the value can be used to compare efficiency of light-bulbs in your daily life, whether that is to save money, or like me, to appreciate how far lighting technology had advanced.

, the physics lab incandescent 5W light-bulb with a luminous efficacy value of 
\begin_inset Formula $0.82 (\si{lm\per W})$
\end_inset

, looks to be as efficient in producing light as a typical fireplace. This is unsurprising, as the outer glass casing of the bulb readily heats up when it is powered, indicating energy loss in the form of thermal energy. A suggestion is to made for the school physics department for a switch to safer (less glass temperature), and more energy efficient light-bulbs for general experiments.

\begin_layout Standard
Here is a list on the handling of the controlled variables/potential error factors, and future improvements to be made.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Random Errors
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Fluctuation of the outside light level
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is potentially a significant factor in creating a large uncertainty and low precision in the raw illuminance data. The advice would be to conduct the experiment at night, or in a totally blackout room without light pollution. This will increase the precision of the experiment and decrease the uncertainty on the luminous efficacy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
The sensitivity of the light sensor
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Insignificant, for the equipment is properly taped down, removing the problem of a shaky hand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
The power supplied to the light-bulb
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Insignificant, for the power held stable during the experiment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Systematic Errors
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Environmental room intensity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A potentially significant variable. The small but existent systematic error is likely to be caused by the erroneous measure of the ambient room light level. Performing the experiment in a blackout room or at night is likely to reduce the effects of the ambient room intensity and increase the accuracy of the dataset, possibility creating a curve that intercepts closer to 0 on the y axis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
The temperature of the bulb filament
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Insignificant, for the power is kept below the operating power limit and a lack of systematic decreasing illuminance during trials.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Parallax placements of the ruler
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A potentially significant variable. For the wooden ruler have depth, an angled top-down view to place the ruler is likely to result in parallax errors, thus systematically displacing the measured distances. It may be wise to have used a paper with beforehand markings of the distances, which is likely in reducing the systematic error shown in the curve, and potentially help bring the intercept closer to point (0,0).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Accuracy of the light sensor
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A variable that I was the most concerned about. This may be the largest cause of the systematic error. I could follow a lengthy calibration test listed on the manufacture's website against a factory calibrated source, which will decrease the systematic error and increase the accuracy of the data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Further Investigations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider repeating the experiment with several other household lighting sources â€” LED, halogen, or fluorescent light-bulbs, and compare their typical luminous efficacy. The information can be used to determine the efficiency of different types of light sources to help the physics department to choose more efficient light-bulbs.
