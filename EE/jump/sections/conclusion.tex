\section{Conclusion}
This essay explored the optimal jumping displacement of a player in ``Counter Strike, Source''. I first modeled the game with empirical data from the straight line model, deriving the mechanics behind jumping and researching the speed limit. In a case to avoid the speed limit, I've tested theories from both the skilled people and myself, and creating a modification to push the optimization further on the second discrete model. I believe that this exploration is useful towards the tool-assisted speedrun community, owning to the high amount of skill and precision needed for the advance models.
