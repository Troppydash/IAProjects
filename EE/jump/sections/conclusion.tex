This essay explores the optimal jumping displacement of a player in the game of the source engine under modified settings. We first formalized the player motion under the engine in discrete and continuous time, then hypothesized the conditions where displacement may be maximize. The differential equation of the player motion is then derived assuming maximum acceleration in the time domain, and the discrete difference equation is constructed for simulation purposes. Our first model is basic and approached the optimization in continuous time; our second model is more advance and utilized the maximizing of discrete time with the help of polar coordinates, and the extension pushed the displacement further by preventing backtracking player velocity.
