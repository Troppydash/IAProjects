\section{Introduction}

%\paragraph{Research Question:}

In this essay, I will attempt to maximize the jump displacement of a player in the video game ``Counter Strike, Source''\citefoot{source}. This is a competitive game that I enjoy where you control a ``player'' in a simulated 3D space doing objectives. While normally the player's movement --- the velocity in particular --- in the game is limited by a value for fairness sake, I realized that it can be exceeded under certain circumstances. This is extremely helpful in a game where your movement determines you and your team's success, therefore, I sought to master this technique with mathematics.

% This is a result of a friend sending me inhuman like videos of people playing the game, ``exploiting'' it to make themselves move much faster in midair than intended. Out of interest, I found this exploit online and wanted was hooked --- but it is difficult to utilize a new piece of knowledge without understanding it. I want to perfect this act of incredible movement optimally.

To achieve this I would need to select and concentrate on a single matrix to evaluate my models against, because of the myriad uses of this technique in game; I chose the displacement traveled in a player jump for its simplicity. My research question was therefore:
\begin{quote}
    To what extent can I use an input/acceleration function to maximize the player's x,y-axis displacement during one jump above a flat z-axis plane with achievable initial conditions in the video game ``Counter Strike, Source''?
\end{quote}

\subsection{Mathematical definition}
The question is easier to analyze when defined mathematically, but in order to explain the mechanics, let's first consider an analogy to real life. Consider the modeling of a student's movement within a school: we designate him with a position, velocity, and acceleration, then by simply applying the classical laws of motion we can accurately locate him at all times. In the context of the video game, the student is the player, the school is a ``map'', and a similar ``law of motion'' is applied programmatically. Additionally, the game uses ``hammer units'' as units of space and seconds as units of time in its virtual environment.


From my personal experience with the game, and from secondary sources on this topic\citefoot{Kered13}, the player's positions are coordinates of three real numbers, representing its 3D displacement against the map origin coordinate $\tang{0,0,0}$. I will denote this position with a bold $\tp$ using vector notation
\[
    \tp = \tang{x, y, z} = \tpars{x}{y}{z} \quad \text{where} \, x, y, z \in  \mathbb{R}.
\]

Continuing, the game stores the velocity of the player as a real 3-vector as well, which I will denote by a bold $\tv$. The magnitude of these positions, velocities, and any real 3-vectors are computed using Pythagoras's theorem: here is the equation for the player's speed,
\[
    \tmag{\tv} = \sqrt{\tv_x^2+\tv_y^2+\tv_z^2}.
\]

\begin{figure}[H]

        \label{fig:view_ang}
    \end{minipage}
\end{figure}
\footnotetext{\citeall{euler_ang}}


Figure \ref{fig:1coords} is a snapshot of the game showing the two values; the player is at position \verb|pos|:$\tang{226.96, -474.47, 69.52}$ with a velocity of magnitude \verb|vel|:$51.99$. The \verb|ang| value is the Euler angles of the player's direction, showing a pitch of $1.86$ degrees from the x,y-axis and a yaw of $-96.86$ degrees within the x,y-axis (figure \ref{fig:view_ang}).


The game also keeps track of the time elapsed, and updates the player's position and velocity evenly $64$ times a second\citefoot{ticks}. I will denote the time between updates with $\tau$, of value
\[
    \tau = \frac{1}{64} = 0.015625 \si{s}.
\]

Moreover, the acceleration $\ta$ is also a real 3-vector. It is computed every update from the ``wishing'' direction $\td$ --- a real 2-vector in the x,y-axis only --- of the player, which is then applied onto the velocity $\tv_n$ using Euler's method. The position $\tp_n$ is then updated with the new velocity $\tv{n+1}$ through the same method. This sequential process can be represented by the difference equations
\begin{align}
    \tv_{n+1} &= \tv_n + \ta \tau\\
    \tp_{n+1} &= \tp_n + \tv_{n+1} \tau.
\end{align}

    \label{fig:1vecadd}
\end{figure}

The process of one such update is called a ``frame'', and can be visualized through vectors scalings and additions as figure \ref{fig:1vecadd} demonstrates.

It is therefore obvious to see that the player position and velocity are discrete functions of time. While it may be conventional to represent the time parameter as subscripts, I decided against it and instead using a continuous function syntax. This is because the powerful optimization technique --- calculus --- only applies to continuous functions, and I conjecture that the small time-step $\tau$ justifies such transition of discrete to continuous time\citefoot{knoebel_2007}. The function syntax ($f(t)$) easily denotes continuous position and velocity, while still allowing discreteness used in section 3 ($f(n\tau), n\in\mathbb{Z}$).

Without loss of generality, I can model the player's motion with the functions $\tp(t)$ and $\tv(t)$, where $t$ is time elapsed from the start of the jump. The updating process is now approximated by differential equations:
\begin{align}
    \tv'(t) &= \ta(t) \label{eq:1de1}\\
    \tp'(t) &= \tv(t) \label{eq:1de2}.
\end{align}

Ultimately, the problem can be formally stated as:
\begin{quote}
    Given initial position and velocity --- $\tvec{p}(0)$, $\tvec{v}(0)$ --- as three dimensional vectors when the player initializes a jump event, if $\ta(t)$ is the player's acceleration at time $t$, with $\tv(t)$ and $\tp(t)$ being the respective derived velocity and position of the player, what is the achievable maximum displacement $\tmag{\tp(t_f) - \tp(0)}$ if $t_f$ is the total time of the jump?
\end{quote}
%The problem originated from my personal curiosity within the limitations of the video game ``Counter Strike'' that occupies a large part of my life. It came about as I was getting into the community of counter-strike long jumping --- a community aiming to exploit the video game's physics to achieve the longest jumping distance. Therefore I want to explore this optimization problem with various methods in an extended essay to further improve my knowledge within this ``niche`` community.

%\subsection{Defining the problem}
%The ``source'' game engine (citation) is the engine of plenty of popular videos games in terms of handling the players, their surroundings, and their respective physical interactions. It allows freedom in setting various engine constants that fit each video game's playstyle --- with the constants of ``Counter Strike - Source`` being used as a reference throughout this exploration. I will attempt to define the problem mathematically in this section.

% from p0 to p1, and to finishing this essay
%Firstly, here is a run down of all the notations used in this analysis:
%
%All n-dimensional vectors are represented in bold styles like
%\[
%    \tvec{v},
%\]
%their magnitudes, or length are denoted by two double vertical lines, with the components of a vector written as a subscript $x$, $y$, or $z$ like
%\[
%\tmag{\tvec{v}} = \sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2 + v_z^2}.
%\]
%
%The vector can also be expanded into its components, and is written with angled brackets or with square brackets:
%\[
%\tvec{v} = \tang{v_x, v_y, v_z} = \tpars{v_x}{v_y}{v_z}.
%\]
%
%The unit vectors are vectors scaled down by their magnitudes, resulting in a magnitude of 1, and is written with a hat on top:
%\[
%\tunit{v} = \frac{\tvec{v}}{\tmag{v}}.
%\]
%
%The dot product between two vectors $\tvec{v}$ and $\tvec{w}$ is defined by
%\[
%\tvec{v} \cdot \tvec{w} = v_x w_x + v_y w_y + v_z w_z + \ldots.
%\]
%
%In addition, the absolute, floor, and ceiling piecewise functions are represented with
%\[
%    |x|, \floor*{x}, \ceil*{x}.
%\]
%
%Due to the nature of the source engine, the problem may be represented and optimized differently because of the use of discrete time frames rather than continuous time. But experimentally the differences are small and insignificant --- this will be shown later. Both approaches will thus be used, sometimes interchangeably.
%

%
%\subsection{Source mechanics}
%\label{sec:source}
%While the problem may look simple in the context of kinematics and projectile motions, the ``quirks'' in the source engine will increase its complexity. Therefore it is necessary to explore the specifics of the physics engine.
%
%The engine time unit is in seconds; the engine distance unit is in hammerunits (hu), which are to be implied for the rest of the analysis. The player's position and velocities are represented by 3-vectors $\tp$ and $\tv$ in the engine, which are updated every frame by the player controllable acceleration 2-vector $\ta$. Commonly, the source engine runs at an integer number of frames per second (citation), the number $64$ will be used from now. Let $\tau$ be the time between frames (also know as $\Delta t$) and it has a value of $\tau = \frac{1}{64} \approx 0.0156 \si{s}$. For every $\tau$ seconds after $t=0$, the velocity is updated in the following sequence (citations):
%\begin{enumerate}
%    \item Apply gravitational acceleration
%    \item Apply friction onto velocity
%    \item Calculate magnitude of movement acceleration
%    \item Apply movement acceleration
%\end{enumerate}
%
%% took 45 frames, v0 = 284hu/s, 60fps
%\paragraph{Step 1} Let $g$ be the gravitational acceleration on the $z$ axis, it is set by an engine constant \verb|sv_gravity| (citations) --- represented by variable $-g$ set to $800$ within the game in question. Using a method called leapfrog interpolation, and let $\tv'$, $\tp'$ be the new velocity, position next frame, the operation is (assuming $g$ is negative)
%\begin{align}
%    \tv'_z &= \tv_z + g\tau \label{eq:gv}\\
%    \tp'_z &= \tp_z + \tv_z\tau + \frac{1}{2}g\tau^2 \label{eq:gp}.
%\end{align}
%
%Because the updates reflect the kinematic equations of a projectile with constant acceleration, it can be treated with assumption of continuous time and will be evaluated separately against the $x$ and $y$ motions.
%
%
%\paragraph{Step 2} Let $\lambda(\tv)$ be the friction function. For the player is in the air, no friction will be applied and we can set $\lambda(\tv) = \tv$. After this section, the $\lambda$ function will be omitted as we are only considering air motions.
%
%\paragraph{Step 3} The source engine limits the player velocity through an engine constant \verb|sv_maxspeed| ($L$) set to $30$ in air. However, the speed is limited by the projection of the velocity vector $\tv$ onto the acceleration vector $\ta$, with the player having control of $\ta$ at all times (figure \ref{fig:speedlimit}).
%
%\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.40\textwidth}
%    \includegraphics[width=0.37\textwidth,right]{assets/speedlimit.png}
%    \caption{The speed limit}
%    \label{fig:speedlimit}
%\end{wrapfigure}
%
%Let $w$ be the magnitude of the applicable acceleration this frame. It can be defined as a piecewise function as
%\[
%w = \begin{cases}
%    \gamma_1 & \gamma_2 \ge \gamma_1\\
%    \gamma_2 & \gamma_1 > \gamma_2 > 0\\
%    0 & 0 \ge \gamma_2,
%\end{cases}
%\]
%where the definition of $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$ are:
%\begin{align*}
%    \gamma_1 &= LA\tau\\
%    \gamma_2 &= L - \tv \cdot \tunit{\ta},
%\end{align*}
%where the dot product $\tv \cdot \tunit{\ta}$ with the unit acceleration vector represents the projection of velocity onto the acceleration vector.
%
%The variable $\gamma_1$ is a constant represents the highest acceleration and is proportional to the engine constant \verb|sv_airacclerate| ($A$), and \verb|sv_maxspeed| ($L$); variable $\gamma_2$ is a function of $\tv$ representing the signed the difference between $L$ and the projected velocity.
%
%When $\gamma_2$ is negative, meaning the projected velocity is larger than the max speed, no acceleration will occur and $w=0$; when $\gamma_2$ is positive but below $\gamma_1$, meaning that adding the full acceleration will overshoot the max speed, only the difference between the max speed and the current projected velocity is applied, bringing the player to the speed limit on the next frame and $w=\gamma_2$; when $\gamma_2$ is larger than $\gamma_1$, only the upper-bound acceleration is applied and $w=\gamma_1$.
%
%
%
%\paragraph{Step 4} The new velocity on the next frame $\tv'$ (note that we assume step 1 has already been applied this frame) is the combination between the friction and movement acceleration:
%\begin{align}
%    \tv' &= \lambda(\tv) + w \tunit{\ta}\label{eq:dis_vel},
%\end{align}
%with the position being updated without interpolation ($\tp'$):
%\[
%\tp' = \tp + \tv' \tau.
%\]
%
%% jumping mechanics
%% took 45 frames, v0 = 284hu/s, 60fps
%Additionally, the mechanics of initiating a jump action can also be modelled mathematically. By recording myself jumping ingame at 60 frames per second (picture), I've obtained that a jump is represented by an impulse applied on the player, setting its z-axis velocity $v_{0z}$ to around $+280\pm10$ the frame after jumping. The player then takes around $45 \pm1$ video frames to land, meaning an airtime of $45 / 60 =0.75\pm 0.02\si{s}$. Therefore the initial velocity is restricted by $\tv_z = 280\pm10$.
%
%% summarize
%To summarize, every $\tau$ seconds after $t=0$ the velocity is updated by gravity in the z-axis, and by the player's movement acceleration in the x,y-axis. The latter is limited so that the projection of the new velocity never exceeds the engine constant \verb|sv_maxspeed| of 30 in air. Therefore for some time $t$, the velocity next frame $\tv(t+\tau)$ is
%\begin{align*}
%    \tv(t+\tau) &= \tang{\tv_x(t) + w \tunit{a}_x, \tv_y(t) + w\tunit{a}_y,\tv_z(t) + g\tau}\\
%    \tp(t+\tau) &= \tang{\tp_x(t) + \tv(t+\tau)_x \tau, \tp_y(t) + \tv(t+\tau)_y \tau, \tp_z(t) + \tv_z(t)\tau + \frac{1}{2}g\tau^2}.
%\end{align*}
