% intro
The TOK prompt I have chosen is: ``Are some things unknowable?''. This exhibition will explore the prompt by reflecting upon knowledge within sciences, more specifically answering whether uncertainty hinder in the acceptance of knowledge, for it answers the significance of an unknowable knowledge. While in the area of Mathematics we often take deductive reasoning as granted, this is less common in the areas of sciences. Every science experiment contains empirical results, but depending on different people with their own personal backgrounds, beliefs, ideologies, or perspectives, the significance of the result seems to differ between the public. More directly, the lack of trust in the sciences may be a disbelief towards its empirical methods, that uncertainty is untrustworthy and does not bring knowledge.


% knowable thing but could be failified
\paragraph{Object \ref{fig:lod}, The Law of Demand}
This formula comes from the standard theory of economics, and serves to be a controversial topic for its naming inclusion of ``law'', being the historical avant-garde in the social sciences for its perceived certainty of human behavior. The idea is however attacked frequently, particularly by psychologists arguing that the justifications of law is too idealistic in real life, winning a noble price and creating a new branch of economics --- behavior economics.

The equation is interesting for it is an expression of the boldness beliefs of scientist in their models. Economists often back up the law through unrealistic claims that are intentionally broad, marking its failures as a violation of the ``axioms'' of standard economic theory and the case should be treated separately. This showcase a case of false certainty --- marking a relationship to be more knowable than it truly is. On the one hand, it justifies many aspects of modern economic theories, with empirical proof of the success reflected in economical growth number; but it also creates confusions for the learners and critics: coming from a maths background, I did not initial buy into the ``law'' for its vagueness. The framework allows economists to justify their actions while leaving the interpretation of their building blocks to be broad and uncritiqueable.

This object reinforces this exhibition in showcasing the wider vulnerability of science theorems and laws. The natural scientists' critique only serves to reveal the flaws in their ``scientific methods'', that the entirety of physics is in essence, fitting numbers to interpretations. While both parties disagrees in acknowledging the shakiness of their disciplines, they are similar in framing the confusion as an ``interesting property'' and a benefit of the sciences, ultimately displaying how the interpretation of empirical evidence differs depending on your personal beliefs and backgrounds.

% knowable thing but is chaotic
\paragraph{Object \ref{fig:bible}, The bible according to Spike Milligan}
The object is a book issued to me by my history friend out of interest, for it parodies the old testament section of the bible. When people think about the bible, they think of the connection and quotations within it rather than the plausibility and validity of the work. Historically speaking, the bible is special in its unknown origin and writer. Some people view this uncertainty as an argument to reject all meanings within the book, some accepts the knowledge it presents and not by its origin, and some values both interpretations equality.


The parody of the bible is intriguing for it beautifully shows how the context of its origin can be completely different while retaining its messages and knowledge. The first chapter references the creation of the world, but from a perspective of a British startup firm. Surprising stating that the messages of the bible is independent of its context, showcasing how the uncertainty of the origin realistically have little effects on the knowledge presented.

Therefore I have included this bible in the exhibition to be an example where the uncertainty fails to hinder the underlying values and story. Judging from the positive reviews from the various purchasers and I, it seems to display the ability of a common ideology or pure interest to decrease the significance of the ``carrier'' of knowledge. This is in analogy to the ideas presented by the economists --- that the idealistic axioms are justified by a significant result in the knowledge that it creates.


% The object is my personal simulation of some swinging double pendulums. On the surface, it seems that the advances in the natural sciences should be able predict its motions to the atom. But the discovery of chaos questions the fundamental values of physics as a whole. In a sense, some people consider the possibility of uncertainty to be roadblock in the acquiring of knowledge in the sciences.

%Physics as a discipline follows a trend of experiment, theories, and prediction to formulate our understanding of the universe.

% unknowable thing that expresses certainty
\paragraph{Object \ref{fig:download}, The Firefox Progress bar}
The object is a progress bar of a file download in the my Firefox browser. It have the purpose of displaying the time it takes to download this very important file I need, and its existence had own broadened in the information era. Yet it had surprised me to know that the underlying progress it displays has no certainty. The progress bar serves as a distraction to the nondeterministic information of file downloading for the user.

While this little bar can come in many forms, there exist an endless flow of people complaining the inaccuracy of the device, yet the purpose of the device is for the good --- to create feedback upon an action. It implies the idea that covering uncertainty with certainty, where knowledge is deliberately hidden, is undesirable to the masses of internet users. Additionally, versions of progress bars which does not cover the uncertainty does not escape the criticisms. It seems to me that people fear the concept of uncertainty, with the rejection of the underlying knowledge being a separate matter. The progress bar highlights the reverse of the question: that certainty does hinder the acceptance of unknown things.

The common appearances (and criticisms it faces) of the item helps in broadening the scope of the knowledge question. The progress bar showcases the knower's desire for information in the case of a knowledge barrier, and our fear towards accepting uncertainty. I have made progress bars myself in my apps, and I find the understanding of the unknownable helps in reducing the frustration of such a progress bar. This expresses the common, but incorrect thought that one needs to cover up uncertain results with a certainty blanket.
